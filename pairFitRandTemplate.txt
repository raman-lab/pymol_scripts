# Comments:
# Have this file, conformer files, and protein pdb file in working directory
# Run the in bash shell: pymol -qc (path)/pairFitRand.py -- thisFile.txt
# A pdb will be generated for each conformer in each pairing 
# Output will be of the form: (pdb)_(ligand)_rdm_P(pair number)_C(conformer number).pdb
# All conformers must be of the form: (ligand)_Conf(number).pdb
