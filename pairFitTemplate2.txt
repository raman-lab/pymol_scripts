Enter cleaned and relaxed pdb: 4AC0.pdb

Enter name of ligand: Chrys

Which ligand atoms are kept constant (pdbAtoms or ligAtoms): pdbAtoms

Is there a specific area (i.e. Pocket) being aligned (enter No if not): A0

Please list atoms kept constant: C2, C10, C13

Please list atoms for each pairing:
	Pairing 0: C9, C6, C5
	Pairing 1: C14, C6, C5
	Pairing 2: C11, C5, C6
	Pairing 3: C3, C5, C6

# READ ME:
# Have this file, conformer files, and protein pdb file in working directory
# Run the in bash shell: pymol -qc (path)/pairFitTextIn.py -- thisFile.txt
# A pdb will be generated for each conformer in each pairing 
# Output will be of the form: (pdb)_(lig)_A(alignment number)_P(pair number)_C(conformer number).pdb
# All conformers must be of the form: (ligand)_Conf(number).pdb
# All aligned areas are stored as indices (i.e. A0,A1,â€¦,An), so please make note of what Ai corresponds to below
	# i.e. A0 = Poc
# Must have spaces after colons and commas
